<p>Ever since I was young I have been intersted in computers and how web pages were built. From building my first site on Geo Cities to building sites with Squarespace. Using these drag and drop website builders have taught me design aspects and the nesceassary basics of building websites. From there I have taken classes on how to code with HTML, CSS, SASS, JQUERY and JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
When I am not coding I am a husband, I have been happily married for 4 years to my wife and adventure partner Mandela Cocores. She has been one of my biggest inspirations for my coding. She makes me want to stive to suceed and enables me to challenge myself to try be better at what I do.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
I am somone who marches to the beat of my own drum, the person that you can talk to right after meeting them and feel like you have been friends your whole entire life. I am someone who is willing to help out a friend without asking for anything in return as well as someone who takes action.
